I started my Sinatra Portfolio project today and I decided it's time for me to start writing tests for my projects.  It's been in some ways easier and in other ways harder than I expected it to be.  On one hand, using previous labs as a reference has made it easy for me to find examples of how to write tests.  On the other hand, it's an entirely new skill that requires approaching problems in a different way. 

I tend to think of problems in terms of how to start chipping away at them bit by bit, breaking them into smaller parts and solving one piece, then another.  This works especially well when I get into a groove.  I tend to start off slow and build momentum quickly.  Writing tests for the pieces of the problem really seems to help me break things down into manageable chunks in the beginning, but once I get moving and I see where I'm going with the project it's tough to stop my progress to write tests for the next few pieces.  I imagine it will get easier with time as I get more familiar with writing tests.

One place that writing tests has really helped is in making sure my code STAYS functional.  I can usually tell whether a piece of code is working when I first write it without using RSPEC, but I tend to lose sight of keeping that code from breaking as I introduce complexity to the code with additional functionality later on.  Several times today I found myself re-running tests long after I got them to pass and finding that I broke early pieces of my code with later additions.  If it wasn't for having the tests, I might not have found these issues until much later.

Overall, I think writing my own tests is going to help me become a better programmer.  I think that with time and practice it'll get easier and easier to integrate writing tests into my programming routine and, if nothing else, I'll be able to better understand what the tests on future labs are trying to get me to do.
