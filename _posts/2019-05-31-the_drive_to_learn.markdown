I've been thinking a lot lately about the importance of fostering a deep desire to learn within oneself.  There are a lot of great reasons to learn a new skill; whether for personal enjoyment, getting a better job, self-improvement, or out of necessity.  Having a personal drive to learn makes the necessity of having to keep learning an exciting opportunity rather than a burden.  

The bad news is that constantly changing technology means that the job you learned when you first entered the professional work force may not be around for as long as you'd like.  Gone are the days where everybody could learn a trade or a craft and safely plan to support themselves and a family doing that job for the rest of their lives.  The good news is that you probably won't end up having to do the same few tasks day-in and day-out for the next 40(ish) years of your life.  Everything gets boring sooner or later and continuous change can help keep things interesting.

With technology changing at an ever increasing pace, it has become necessary for professionals to continue developing new skills and learning new technologies just to keep up with the needs of the businesses they work for (and/or the businesses they *want* to work for).  Although this need to continue to learn may seem daunting, it's also a great opportunity to keep life interesting.  The information you need to learn a new skill has never been easier to access and accessing a huge amount of that information costs no more than an internet connection.  As long as you can maintain an attitude of wanting to learn for the sake of learning, learning new skills can be both fun and practically free.
