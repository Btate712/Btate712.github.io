I'm currently a Senior Operations Training Instructor at a nuclear power plant.  I make a great salary doing work that I, on most days, enjoy doing.  So why would I be taking steps to move out of an established and successful career to start doing something totally different?  

I can remember my first programming class in 5th grade.  I was lucky to be at a school which, at the time, was forward thinking enough to have a class in BASIC programming.  I looked forward to my programming class every day.  I loved being presented new puzzles to solve using tools that were new and exciting to me.

I grew up in the days of dial-up internet, when I was lucky to get online for an hour each week.  Any programming I did outside of the very few classes my school offered was just practicing the skills I had learned in my first programming class.  Still, my grade school programming days had such a strong effect on me that when it came time to choose a college major, computer science seemed to be an obvious choice.  I had a deep interest in learning about software development and I couldn't wait to learn more.  Unfortunately for me (or maybe not... I'm very lucky to be where I'm at in life and I might not have gotten here had I chosen a different path), I wasn't at my most career oriented/motivated point in my life and I wasted my college years focusing on all of the wonderful non-academic distractions that college life has to offer.  I dropped out of school by my second year.

After leaving school I spent time in the restaurant business before going to the Navy and becoming a submarine reactor operator.  Some of the work I did on the submarine, like troubleshooting microprocessor equipment, was faintly reminiscent of the programming I had done before.  I left the Navy for a commercial nuclear power plant training job when my time in the Navy was done and I've worked at that power plant for seven years now, which brings me back to the original question:  Why make a change now?

Ultimately, I'm ready for a change.  I need something new to focus on and I've always loved programming.  I've done several jobs in my professional career and I've seen how software has made life easier and I know that there are many more places where things can keep being made better and easier.  I want to be a part of making that happen.
